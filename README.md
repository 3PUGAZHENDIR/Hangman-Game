## 🌟 Features

- **Random Word Selection:** The game picks a word randomly from a set list, ensuring each playthrough is a new challenge.
- **Letter Guessing:** Guess one letter at a time and reveal the hidden word progressively.
- **Guess Tracking:** Keep track of your correct and incorrect guesses with feedback on each attempt.
- **Endgame Notifications:** Get notified if you win or lose and see the final word.
